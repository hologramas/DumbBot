# DumbBot program.
This program runs on an a MakerBlock master board controlling a robot starter kit in tank mode.
The goal of the problem is to demonstrate that computers do only what they are told by a sequence of steps even if the steps do not make "common" sense.
I created this program to show a first grade elementary class that software programming is about creating a set of steps a machine follows, and that the machine does nothing more than what the steps say.<p>
The program can do following things:
1. Make the bot move forward regardless of any obstacles.
2. Make the bot move forward until an obstacle is detected by the ultrasound sensor and then stop.
3. Make the bot turn around when a loud sound is detected.
4. Make the bot move automatically forward and turn around from any obstacles.
5. Make the bot stop.
