<header>Dumbbot program</>
This program runs on an a MakerBlock master board controlling a robot starter kit in tank mode.<br>
The goal of the problem is to demonstrate that computers do only what they are told by a sequence of steps even if the steps do not make "common" sense.<br>
I created this program to show a first grade elementary class that software programming is about creating a set of steps a machine follows, and that the machine does nothing more than what the steps say.<p>
The program can do following things:<br>
1. Make the bot move forward regardless of any obstacles.<br>
2. Make the bot move forward until an obstacle is detected by the ultrasound sensor and then stop.<br>
3. Make the bot turn around when a loud sound is detected.<br>
4. Make the bot move automatically forward and turn around from any obstacles.<br>
5. Make the bot stop.<br>
